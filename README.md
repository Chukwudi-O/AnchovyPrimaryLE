# AnchovyPrimaryLE
LOCAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. To use this software locally on your computer you must have an application called XAMPP installed. Go to the XAMPP website and download the version of XAMPP for your operating system.
2. In the folder where you have xampp installed, you will put the project folder "AnchovyPrimaryLE-main" inside a folder called "htdocs".
3. Open your "XAMPP Control Panel" and click the start buttons for 'Apache' and 'MySQL'.
4. To be able to login to the application there is a .sql file inside the project folder called "apsle.sql" which you will need to import into "phpmyadmin" to create and populate the database with default logins for demo usability. New users can be created and old ones removed at any time so do not worry and the default login info will be shown below. Next go into your browser and type "localhost/phpmyadmin" in the search bar and you will be redirected. Click the import button at the top of the screen and you will be redirected to a page where you must upload the sql file "apsle.sql" and click the "GO" button. Now you are ready to start the application.
5. Go into your browser (NB: this works well with Chrome) and type into the search bar "localhhost/AnchovyPrimaryLE-main/html" and you will be directed to the home screen of the program where you may select between 3 portals to login "administrator", "teacher", "student". The default login information including in the sql file are as follows.
